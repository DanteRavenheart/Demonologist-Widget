# Demonologist-Widget
A widget for streamers who play Demonologist to track evidence and ghost types


To set it up we are going to need to create a custom widget.
I use Streamelements. You can add this to an existing overlay or make a new overlay.
Once you have the overlay open and you see the blue + button click it go to static/custom and then click custom widget.
This will make a new widget. From there click into open editor.
Now, You will want to copy everything from the HTML document into the HTML tab in the editor. Go Ahead and replace everything in it.
You will repeat that for each seperate document CSS goes into the CSS Tab, JS goes into the JS tab, and Fields goes into the fields tab.
Again Replace everything in each category. Data you do not need to touch.
From there should you have done it right, you will now see under where it says OPEN EDITOR drop down menu's this is how from here you can customize the widget to your
liking. From changing the chat commands to customizing the borders.


Make sure you hit the giant blue SAVE button.


If this is going to be a seperate overlay and not put into your main overlay, go to sources, add new browser source, add like you would any other overlay.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me VIA discord and I will answer as quick as I can.
